You'll be given a string, and have to return the sum of all characters as an int. The function should be able to handle all printable ASCII characters.

Examples:

uniTotal("a") == 97
uniTotal("aaa") == 291

my answer
def uni_total(s):
    new_list = sum([ord(list) for list in s])
    return new_list
